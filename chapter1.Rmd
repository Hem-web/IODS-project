My Feelings
Right now i am feeling great becuase i have started something really new. I knew R exist and we could do lot of statistical analyses and data visulaization  with it, but working with R and github togther is very amazing. From this course i am expecting to expand my basics of R with some new techniques on data visulaization. I got the information about this course from my colleague.
