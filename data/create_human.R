# Exploring the data
 ##The human data is the part of a big data produced by "United Nations Development Programme". 
 ##This data is combination of two difference human development indices called, "Human Development Index (HDI)" and "Gender Inequality Index (GNI)"
 ##This data contains 195 observations in 19 different variables. 
 ##HDI accounts long and healthy lives (life.exB), Knowledge (expect.edu and mean.edu), and a decent standard living (GNI.capita) as three dimesnions.
 ##GII accounts health (MMR and adols.BR), empowerment (secedu.F and secedu.M), and labor market (labour.particip.F and labour.particip.M)as three dimesnions.
 ## In addition, the data also conatins, HDI itself, HDI and GII ratios, and also the newly formulated variables secedu.R (ratio of secedu2F tosecedu2M) and labour ratio (ratio of labour.particip.F to labour.particip.M)

#In R, NA stands for not available, which means that the data point is missing.

  #1.Remove the observations with missing values
  #2.Replace the missing values with actual values using an imputation technique.
