#Comment on the data dimensions and structures: 
#In both data sets there are 33 variables which were accounted to evaluate the performance of students 
# on two subjects, mathematics and portugese language in two different portugese schools. There were
#395 observations on  those variables for mathematics and 649 observations for portugese language.

library(dplyr)

# Define own id for both datasets

# Which columns vary in datasets
free_cols <- c("id","failures","paid","absences","G1","G2","G3")

# The rest of the columns are common identifiers used for joining the datasets
